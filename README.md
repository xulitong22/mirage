# Mirage

Mirage is a Python package designed to facilitate common image processing tasks. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with images in Python. Users can perform various operations on images, such as resizing, cropping, converting between different formats, and more. Unique to the library is its focus on type safety, support for gradients and alpha channels, and seamless integration with PyTorch for deep learning tasks.

## Features

- Image Class: The Image class represents an image and provides methods for various operations such as cropping, resizing, converting between formats, and more.
- Support for Multiple Image Modes: The library supports different image modes including Grayscale, RGB, and RGBA, allowing flexibility in working with various types of images.
- Static Methods for Image Operations: Static methods like merge_channels and create_rectangle provide functionality for merging image channels and creating rectangular images, respectively.
- Integration with PIL and PyTorch: The library seamlessly integrates with PIL for image processing tasks and PyTorch for tensor operations, enabling a wide range of image processing capabilities.
- Generics Support: The use of generics allows for type-safe operations, ensuring that the correct types are used throughout the codebase.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy
- Pytorch
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)
